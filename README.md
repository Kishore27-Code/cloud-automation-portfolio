# Cloud Automation Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as my **cloud automation practice portfolio**. It contains projects, experiments, and learning exercises using AWS, Terraform, Docker, Python, and Git. The goal is to document my hands-on experience and track my progress in cloud automation.

## Learning Plan
1. **AWS Cloud**
   - Create and manage resources (EC2, RDS, S3)
   - Budget alerts and cost management
   - Automate resource management using AWS Budgets + SNS
2. **Terraform**
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practice
   - Deploy and manage AWS resources programmatically
3. **Docker**
   - Containerization of applications
   - Building, running, and managing containers
4. **Python**
   - Scripting for automation
   - Integrating with AWS APIs (boto3)
5. **Git & GitHub**
   - Version control for projects
   - Documenting progress and best practices

## Projects / Practice Ideas
- AWS $1 budget alert setup with SNS notifications
- Launch and manage EC2/RDS instances programmatically
- Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure
- Dockerized sample Python applications
- Automating repetitive tasks using Python and cloud APIs

## Module 0 — Quick Setup Status
**Goal:** Get accounts & tools ready to practice anytime.

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Create AWS free-tier account | ✅ Done |
| Configure AWS Budgets & SNS alerts | ✅ Done |
| Create GitHub repo (`cloud-automation-portfolio`) | ✅ Done |
| Install Terraform, Docker, Python, Git locally | ✅ Done |
| Initialize README.md locally | ⬜ Optional if editing directly on GitHub |
| Push README.md to GitHub | ⬜ Optional if editing directly on GitHub |

**Note:** Module 0 is effectively complete once the README is in the repo.  

## Notes
- This repo will be updated regularly as I complete new exercises.
- All scripts, configs, and notes are for **learning purposes**.
